      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
        Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
        result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
        of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
        and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.

      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
        should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
        consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
        limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
        its value as a standard.
